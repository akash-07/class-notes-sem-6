### Ricardo's Fallacy: Mutual benefit from trade based on comparative costs and specialization?

* Productivity of two countries A and B in terms of labor hrs.

  *Country A has 200 labor hours and country B has 400 labor hours.*



  |Product| A     | B     |
  | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
  |Cloth| 2       | 4       |
  |Wine| 1       | 2.5       |


* Assuming each country uses half of its person days for production of each good, we have the following output:


  | Product     | A     |B     | Total |
  | :------------- | :------------- |:------------- |:------------- |
  | Cloth       | 50       |50       | 100|
  | Wine       | 100       |80       | 180|

* Ricardo's two country, two commodity model states that both countries will have a vector-wise improvement in the consumption of the goods if they specialize in the production of good in which they have relatively lower cost and exchange with each other.

  Country B has relatively lower cost of production of Cloth and hence specializes in production of cloth while A specializes in production of wine.


  | Product     | A     |B     | Total |
  | :------------- | :------------- |:------------- |:------------- |
  | Cloth       | --       |100       | 100|
  | Wine       | 200       |--       | 200|

  Total consumption after trade:

  | Product     | A     |B     | Total |
  | :------------- | :------------- |:------------- |:------------- |
  | Cloth       | 50       |50       | 100|
  | Wine       | 110       |90       | 200|

  Thus we can see that country B gets to consume 10 more units of wine while country A gets to consume 10 more units of wine post trade. Thus both countries mutually benefit.

* Mutual benefits from sharing higher output is taken as the basis for specialization and exchange. Ricardo put this forward as an extremely general argument with no exceptions whatsoever.

* The **material fallacy** that exists in Ricardo's argument is the assumption that both goods can be produced in both countries. It becomes an inapplicable argument when we consider trade between advanced countries and tropical developing countries. It only holds for countries having similar production structure.

* The countries A and B above are actually Portugal and Britain as described by Ricardo in his paper. Britain, due to its cold temperature conditions could never grow grapes while Portugal could produce large supplies of wine. Hence the assumption that both countries can produce both goods does not hold even for countries stated by Ricardo himself.

* Ricardo uses the terms `growing wine` and `processing wine` interchangeably. Where `growing wine` is dependent on climate, `processing wine` is not, hence this leads to verbal fallacy. It was not possible to grow grapes in England and hence the production frontier of the cloth to wine could not even be defined for Britain. This showed ambiguous use of language by Ricardo.

*The above tables can be redrawn to show that there is not vector-wise improvement in the consumption of goods post trade if one country is not able to produce one of the goods under the assumption of full employment.*

* The cloth and wine trade between Britain and Portugal was not due to comparative advantage but due to mercantilist policies of attaining naval dominance by Britain. The treaty of Methuen in 1703 opened up Portugal markets for British trade while it also allowed imports of primary goods from Portugal into Britain. This convolved into British producing cloth in exchange of wine which it couldn't produce and Portugal thus became a primary goods exporter.

* One might claim that Britain could always import raw materials that it cannot produce and then process them using advanced technology to produce goods cheaper than the country which exported the raw materials itself but this argument raises its own deep problems.
  1. Britain followed an extremely protectionist policy ever seen in history. It banned imports most of the finished cotton products from countries like India and Persia while charging very high tariffs on the other.
  2. The same British cloth flooded Indian markets at cheap price and killed Indian textile industry. Thus the argument of importing raw materials from India and exporting finished products in the name of 'free trade for mutual benefit' is highly fallacious.
  3. This technology route does not rescue Ricardo. One can hardly consider this technological change independently of political power that can lead to mutual benefits via free trade.   

**Conclusion:** Thus Ricardian argument of free trade via comparative advantage under the name of **general theory of free trade** has been falsely accepted and reproduced throughout the years. One must not ignore the exceptions that Ricardo over looked before considering it to be a **general theory of free trade**.
