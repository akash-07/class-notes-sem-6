### Making free trade fair

- Motivation: Asymmetries in free trade
- Author: Joseph Stiglitz

- Points I need to cover: NAFTA, Consequences of trade liberalization, making globalization work, etc.

- 4 points on background
    1. Trade has never been free nor fair
    2. Risk of joblessness and other consequences
    3. Rich countries with poor people
    4. Developing countries cease to reap the benefits

- Mexico and America
    1. Per capita 6 times
    2. Huge immigration

- NAFTA
  1. On Jan 1, 1994 to achieve economic growth via trade liberalization
  2. Non tariff barriers still in place
  3. America could subsidize but Mexico was not allowed to
  4. Dumping and anti dumping charges

  Problem: Trade agreement not fair (asymmetric)

  Solution: Right measures and right policies

- Consequences of trade liberalization
  1. Comparative advantage and specialization
  2. Increase unemployment
  3. Fall in government revenue
  4. Unskilled ~ bottom workers suffer
  5. Protection of infant economies: Critics - Not protection but competition; infant economies never grow

- Fair trade can be regarded as a trade regime that would emerge if all trade restrictions and subsidies were eliminated; hardly possible

- WTO rounds accused of overlooking agendas of developing countries; more to read on WTO rounds

- Making globalization work:
  1. Preferential treatment
  2. Free trade for poor
  3. Broadening developing countries development agenda

-  Impact of subsidy: Most farm products subsidized by USA in huge quantities; badly affects farmers in developing nations; cows get $2 as subsidy a day > what people in developing nations live on

- Developed countries focus on capital market liberalization while the essence lies in liberalization of labor flows

- USA pushed bilateral trade agreements after Uruguay round. Highly discouraged as it threatens formations of multilateral trade agreements. Economic and political strengths of nations play a huge role when agendas are set.  

- Conclusion: Author proposes a tribunal that can look over all laws, trade policies and give punishments to those who abandon promised laws. Globalization can benefit one and all when policies of trade liberalization are accompanied with rational measures, when asymmetric trade will be eliminated via right policies taking care of needs of developing countries.
