## Making free trade fair

**Background:**
This extract speaks about the pitfalls of free trade and suggests what can actually be done to make globalization and free trade work.

### NAFTA

**Relations between America and Mexico:**

Mexican immigration to US has been large. Vast parts of US rely on Mexican labor in the areas of agriculture, manufacturing, and unskilled services. Some 10 million Mexicans are living, legally or illegally in US. There is great disparity in economic and political power between the two countries. America's per capita income is 6 times that of Mexico. High unemployment in Mexico with this 6 fold wage difference pulls Mexican workers to risk their lives to enter illegally. This is not in US's interest to have a poor, unstable country at it's southern border. NAFTA was put forth hoping this would bring prosperity to both nations and bridge the economic gap.

**On trade liberalization:**

- Most trade agreements of the past have neither been free nor fair. They have been asymmetric. A host of subtle but effective trade barriers has been kept in place. This has left developing countries worse off than what they would be without trade.
- It is often found that the developing countries lack the infrastructure to bring their goods to the market and also that their goods will take years to meet the standards of advanced industrial countries.
- Trade liberalization poses the risk of being thrown out of their jobs to the workers as a result of surge in imports. But for workers in developed nations, there is strong safety net of education, bank accounts, severance pays, etc. Workers in developing nations have none of these.
- Trade liberalization leads to rich countries with poor people.

Hence, only if trade liberalization is accompanied with right measures, right policies will help development.

**Why NAFTA failed?**

US --> Mexico

- US exported subsidized goods (ex. corn)
- Poor Mexican farmers could not compete
- Mexico was not allowed to impose tariffs under the notion of **free or liberal trade**

Mexico --> US

- US producers forced the government to act against the cheap Mexican goods (ex. tomatoes)
- US levied dumping and anti-dumping charges
- Mexico agreed to not to risk a trial
- Mexican producers were thus hurt

**What went wrong?**

A fairer trade agreement would have eliminated America's agricultural subsidies and it's restrictions on import of Mexican goods.

Tariffs were eliminated but a whole set of non tariff barriers were in place.

**Some positive sides of NAFTA**

Only part of Mexico that was successful was the area just south of US border called Maquiladora. It saw increased employment in recent years of NAFTA but that too declined in the following years.

**What do we conclude from NAFTA?**

Tariffs play an important but limited role. Hence by just focusing on tariffs, we should not ignore other non tariff barriers that continue to make crucial impacts on *free* trade. Right policies and right measures are essential in making free trade work. Countries should invest in education, R&D, etc.

### Trade liberalization: Theory and Practice

Adam Smith believed in free trade with the idea of comparative advantage benefitting both nations. Large trading allows firms and individuals to specialize further. Free trade is a substitute for people actually having to move.

**The Fear of Job Loss**

- With sudden trade liberalization increasing the imports, the private sector does not get time to respond and create new jobs, thus leading to unemployment.
- When workers move from low-productivity, protected jobs into unemployment, it is poverty, not growth, that is likely to increase.
- If not unemployment, the workers see their wages decrease. They are told to wait now and accept the conditions under the claim that they will benefit in long run. Examples show that no such benefits have been observed even after 10-20 years after liberalization.
- John Keynes responds by saying, *"Yes, in the long run, we are all dead"*.
- Even if free trade benefits, it won't benefit all for sure. Rich will be rich and poor will be more poor.

*Why Adam Smith's model doesn't work?*

- Firstly there is never a perfect competition or perfect insurance markets as expected by Adam Smith's model. Microsofts and Intels do dominate.
- In Smith's world, there is no fear from job loss since people can move seamlessly into other jobs. Even if there is some glitch, workers can get risk insurance, insurance for being temporarily unemployed, etc. This is not possible in real life.   

*Conclusions On free Trade*

- More than one time assistance is needed with free trade. For ex. What do we do when the foreign country suddenly devalues its currency and the local vendors are thrown out of competition?
- Free liberalization requires removing tariffs but they do form an important source of income for less developed countries.
- Many a times developing countries do not have good infrastructure for exporting goods and other times they actually have nothing to export that meets industry standards. This is where they need elongated support than just liberalizing free trade.

*It is better to see aid and trade as complements: both are needed for successful development.*

**Infant Industries and Infant Economies**

- New industries often need time to compete with their foreign counterparts. They learn with experience and how fast they acquire knowledge matters.
- Developing countries need to protect their industries until they are strong enough to compete with established giants. This maybe achieved by imposing tariffs or other non tariff barriers all put under one name: **Infant industry protection**.
- Advocates of free trade criticize infant industry protection with two reasons:
  1. Its not protection that is required instead if the companies know that they can benefit in the long run, they can simply take loans in their hard times.
  2. Infant industries do not grow even after protection (most of them).
- In practicality, acquiring funds or loans is not so easy and even the US government has only partially overcome this problem by having a small Business Administration (SBA) that provides loans for small businesses.  
- Protectionism also affects investment in other areas by the government.

*Infant Economies*

Something to do with broad-based protection and innovation.

*Conclusion:*

It is exports and not the removal of trade barriers that is the driving force of growth. Studies show little relationship between liberalization and growth.
